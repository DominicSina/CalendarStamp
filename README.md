# CalendarStamp
Simple xamarin app to start/end calendar events on your phone. Each event represents a work day.


Created workevents are forgotten when the app is closed. This means you will have to set an endtime and update
the description manually.

Future features(that might never arrive):
-Show work events
  -show last/running event
  -list of created events
-Fetch events on restart
-Customize description/name of the events
